# Overview
This folder contains the Autodesk EAGLE board (.brd) and schematic (.sch) files I created to assist with the hardware side of the robot we simulated for RRT.

The stepper motor drivers we used were the [ULN2003A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ULN2003A) with the [28BYJ](https://lastminuteengineers.com/28byj48-stepper-motor-arduino-tutorial/) stepper motor.

I personally milled the pcb on my desktop CNC machine, a Genmitsu 3018PRO, using the .grbl files in the [useful](/RoboticsPCB/useful/) directory. I converted the files to .gcode via [Flatcam](http://flatcam.org/manual/introduction.html) and used a 30Â° drill bit to isolate the traces.
